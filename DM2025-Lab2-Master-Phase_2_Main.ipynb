    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "**I. Fine-tuning (The Most Common Approach)**\n",
       "\n",
       "Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained LLM and further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to learn new patterns and nuances relevant to the target application.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Full Fine-tuning:**\n",
       "    *   **Description:** All parameters of the pre-trained LLM are updated during training.\n",
       "    *   **Pros:** Can achieve the best performance for the specific task as the entire model adapts.\n",
       "    *   **Cons:** Computationally expensive, requires significant memory, and can lead to catastrophic forgetting (where the model loses its general capabilities).\n",
       "    *   **When to use:** When maximum performance on a specific task is paramount and computational resources are not a major constraint.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT):** These methods aim to reduce the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning more efficient in terms of computation, memory, and storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**\n",
       "        *   **Description:** Injects trainable low-rank matrices into specific layers of the pre-trained model. Only these low-rank matrices are trained, while the original model weights remain frozen.\n",
       "        *   **Pros:** Significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, faster training, smaller storage footprint for adapters, less prone to catastrophic forgetting.\n",
       "        *   **Cons:** Might not reach the absolute peak performance of full fine-tuning in all cases.\n",
       "        *   **When to use:** A very popular and effective method for most fine-tuning tasks, especially when dealing with limited resources or when deploying multiple task-specific models.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Adapter Layers:**\n",
       "        *   **Description:** Inserts small, trainable \"adapter\" modules between the layers of the pre-trained LLM. The original LLM weights are frozen.\n",
       "        *   **Pros:** Similar benefits to LoRA in terms of efficiency and reduced forgetting.\n",
       "        *   **Cons:** Can introduce slight latency due to the added layers.\n",
       "        *   **When to use:** Another good PEFT option, often compared to LoRA.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Prefix Tuning / P-Tuning:**\n",
       "        *   **Description:** Learns a small, continuous \"prefix\" or \"prompt\" that is prepended to the input sequence. The LLM's weights are frozen.\n",
       "        *   **Pros:** Very parameter-efficient, can be effective for certain tasks.\n",
       "        *   **Cons:** Can be less flexible than LoRA or adapters for complex tasks.\n",
       "        *   **When to use:** When you want to steer the model's behavior without modifying its core weights, often for tasks like text generation or classification.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Prompt Tuning:**\n",
       "        *   **Description:** Similar to prefix tuning, but learns a set of trainable \"soft prompts\" that are prepended to the input. The LLM's weights are frozen.\n",
       "        *   **Pros:** Extremely parameter-efficient, can be very effective for specific tasks.\n",
       "        *   **Cons:** The learned prompts are not human-readable.\n",
       "        *   **When to use:** When you need to adapt the model with minimal computational overhead and are comfortable with learned, non-interpretable prompts.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **QLoRA:**\n",
       "        *   **Description:** An optimization of LoRA that quantizes the pre-trained model to 4-bit precision, further reducing memory usage and enabling fine-tuning of very large models on consumer hardware.\n",
       "        *   **Pros:** Enables fine-tuning of massive LLMs on significantly less hardware.\n",
       "        *   **Cons:** Potential for slight degradation in performance compared to higher precision.\n",
       "        *   **When to use:** When you need to fine-tune extremely large LLMs and have limited GPU memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Instruction Tuning**\n",
       "\n",
       "Instruction tuning focuses on training LLMs to follow instructions given in natural language. This makes them more versatile and better at zero-shot or few-shot learning.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Description:** The LLM is trained on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triplets. The goal is to teach the model to understand and execute a wide range of tasks based on textual instructions.\n",
       "*   **Pros:** Improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks, makes it more user-friendly, and enhances its performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings.\n",
       "*   **Cons:** Requires carefully curated instruction datasets.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** To create general-purpose chatbots, assistants, or models that can perform many different tasks without explicit fine-tuning for each.\n",
       "\n",
       "**III. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**\n",
       "\n",
       "RLHF is a powerful technique for aligning LLM behavior with human preferences, making them safer, more helpful, and less prone to generating undesirable content.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Description:**\n",
       "    1.  **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** A base LLM is fine-tuned on a dataset of high-quality demonstrations.\n",
       "    2.  **Reward Model Training:** Human annotators rank different model outputs for the same prompt. A reward model is trained to predict these human preferences.\n",
       "    3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** The LLM is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO algorithm), where the reward model provides feedback to guide the LLM towards generating outputs that are preferred by humans.\n",
       "*   **Pros:** Crucial for aligning LLMs with human values, improving safety, reducing toxicity, and enhancing helpfulness.\n",
       "*   **Cons:** Complex to implement, requires significant human annotation effort, and can be computationally intensive.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** To create safe, ethical, and helpful AI assistants, chatbots, and other applications where human alignment is critical.\n",
       "\n",
       "**IV. Prompt Engineering (Not strictly \"tuning\" but a related adaptation method)**\n",
       "\n",
       "While not modifying the model's weights, prompt engineering is a crucial technique for guiding LLM behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Description:** Carefully crafting the input prompt to elicit the desired output from the LLM. This can involve providing context, examples (few-shot learning), specifying the desired format, or using specific keywords.\n",
       "*   **Pros:** No training required, quick to iterate, can be very effective for many tasks.\n",
       "*   **Cons:** Can be brittle, requires experimentation, and may not be sufficient for complex or highly specialized tasks.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** For quick experimentation, when you don't have the resources for fine-tuning, or to complement fine-tuned models.\n",
       "\n",
       "**V. Other Advanced Techniques**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Knowledge Distillation:** Training a smaller, \"student\" model to mimic the behavior of a larger, \"teacher\" LLM. This is useful for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices.\n",
       "*   **Continual Learning:** Methods that allow LLMs to learn new information or adapt to new tasks over time without forgetting previously learned knowledge.\n",
       "*   **Domain Adaptation:** Specifically tailoring an LLM to a particular domain (e.g., medical, legal, financial) by training on domain-specific data. This can be a form of fine-tuning.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Choosing the Right Method:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The best method for tuning an LLM depends on several factors:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Task Complexity:** Simple tasks might be solvable with prompt engineering, while complex tasks often require fine-tuning.\n",
       "*   **Data Availability:** The amount and quality of your task-specific data will influence your choice.\n",
       "*   **Computational Resources:** Full fine-tuning is resource-intensive, while PEFT methods are more efficient.\n",
       "*   **Desired Performance:** If peak performance is critical, full fine-tuning might be necessary, but PEFT often offers a good trade-off.\n",
       "*   **Safety and Alignment Requirements:** RLHF is essential for ensuring safe and aligned behavior.\n",
       "*   **Deployment Constraints:** For edge devices or mobile applications, parameter-efficient methods or distillation are preferred.\n",
       "\n",
       "In practice, a combination of these methods is often used. For example, an LLM might first be instruction-tuned, then further fine-tuned using LoRA for a specific task, and finally aligned with human preferences using RLHF."

       "\n",
       "PEFT methods aim to reduce the computational and memory costs of fine-tuning by only updating a small subset of parameters or adding a few new trainable parameters, while keeping the vast majority of the pre-trained model frozen.\n",

Only $A$ and $B$ are trained, while $W_0$ remains frozen. The rank $r$ (dimension of the inner product of $A$ and $B$) is a hyperparameter.\n",

       "    2.  **Reward Model (RM) Training:** A separate model (often a smaller LLM) is trained to predict human preferences. Humans rank or score different model outputs for a given prompt. The RM learns to assign a \"reward\" score to an LLM's response based on these human preferences.\n",
       "    3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** The SFT model is then fine-tuned using an RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO). The RM acts as the reward function, guiding the LLM to generate responses that maximize the predicted human preference score.\n",

       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   **Extremely complex and resource-intensive:** Requires significant engineering effort, large amounts of human-labeled preference data, and substantial compute.\n",
       "    *   **Data collection is challenging:** Gathering high-quality human preference data is expensive and time-consuming.\n",
       "    *   Can introduce biases present in the human feedback.\n",

       "Tuning a large language model (LLM) is a crucial step to adapt its general capabilities to specific tasks, domains, or desired behaviors. There are several categories of methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here's a breakdown of the most common and effective approaches:\n",
       "\n",
       "## 1. Fine-tuning (Full Fine-tuning)\n",
       "\n",
       "This is the most traditional and comprehensive method.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** You take a pre-trained LLM and continue training it on a new, task-specific dataset. This involves updating *all* the parameters of the model.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the target task.\n",
       "    *   Allows the model to deeply learn the nuances of the new data.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   **Computationally expensive:** Requires significant GPU resources and time.\n",
       "    *   **Large storage requirements:** The fine-tuned model is as large as the original pre-trained model.\n",
       "    *   **Catastrophic forgetting:** The model might forget some of its general knowledge from pre-training if the fine-tuning dataset is very different or too small.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** When you have a substantial amount of high-quality, task-specific data and the computational resources to support it. This is often the go-to for achieving the best possible performance on a specific downstream task.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Methods\n",
       "\n",
       "These methods aim to reduce the computational and storage costs of fine-tuning by only updating a small subset of the model's parameters or by introducing a small number of new parameters.\n",
       "\n",
       "### a) Adapter-based Methods\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** Small, trainable \"adapter\" modules are inserted between the layers of the pre-trained LLM. Only the parameters of these adapters are trained, while the original LLM weights remain frozen.\n",
       "*   **Examples:** Adapters, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), QLoRA (Quantized LoRA).\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters.\n",
       "    *   Much faster training and lower memory usage compared to full fine-tuning.\n",
       "    *   Smaller storage footprint for the fine-tuned components.\n",
       "    *   Less prone to catastrophic forgetting.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   May not reach the absolute peak performance of full fine-tuning in all cases.\n",
       "    *   Adds a slight inference latency due to the extra adapter layers.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** When computational resources are limited, you need to fine-tune for many different tasks, or you want to avoid catastrophic forgetting. LoRA and QLoRA are currently very popular and effective.\n",
       "\n",
       "### b) Prompt Tuning / Prefix Tuning\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** Instead of modifying the model's weights, these methods learn a small set of continuous \"prompt\" or \"prefix\" embeddings that are prepended to the input. The LLM's weights are frozen.\n",
       "*   **Examples:** Prompt Tuning, Prefix Tuning, P-Tuning.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Extremely parameter-efficient (only a few hundred or thousand parameters to train).\n",
       "    *   Very fast training.\n",
       "    *   No modification to the original LLM architecture.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Performance can be more sensitive to initialization and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
       "    *   May not be as effective as adapter-based methods for complex tasks.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** For tasks where a simple prompt can effectively guide the model, and extreme parameter efficiency is paramount.\n",
       "\n",
       "### c) LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** This is a very popular PEFT method. It injects trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into specific layers (typically attention layers) of the pre-trained model. Instead of updating the full weight matrix, it updates these smaller, low-rank matrices.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Highly effective at reducing trainable parameters while maintaining performance.\n",
       "    *   Can be combined with quantization (QLoRA) for even greater efficiency.\n",
       "    *   Relatively easy to implement and integrate.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Still requires some computational resources, though much less than full fine-tuning.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** A strong default choice for most PEFT scenarios due to its balance of efficiency and performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### d) QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** An optimization of LoRA that uses quantization techniques (e.g., 4-bit NormalFloat) to further reduce memory usage. It quantizes the pre-trained model weights to a lower precision while keeping the LoRA adapters in higher precision during training.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Enables fine-tuning of very large models on consumer-grade hardware.\n",
       "    *   Significant memory savings.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Potential for slight degradation in performance due to quantization, though often negligible.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** When you need to fine-tune extremely large models (e.g., 65B parameters) on limited hardware.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Instruction Tuning\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** This is a form of fine-tuning where the model is trained on a dataset of instructions and their corresponding outputs. The goal is to teach the model to follow instructions and perform a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot manner.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Improves the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen tasks described by instructions.\n",
       "    *   Enhances conversational abilities and task completion.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Requires a diverse and well-curated instruction dataset.\n",
       "    *   Can be computationally intensive if done on a large scale.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** To make LLMs more versatile and better at understanding and executing user commands. Many modern LLMs are instruction-tuned.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 4. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** This is a multi-stage process:\n",
       "    1.  **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** The LLM is fine-tuned on a dataset of high-quality demonstrations.\n",
       "    2.  **Reward Model Training:** Human annotators rank different model outputs for the same prompt. A separate reward model is trained to predict these human preferences.\n",
       "    3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** The LLM is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO algorithm), where the reward model provides the reward signal.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Aligns the model's behavior with human values, safety, and preferences.\n",
       "    *   Can lead to more helpful, honest, and harmless outputs.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Complex and resource-intensive to implement.\n",
       "    *   Requires significant human annotation effort.\n",
       "    *   Can be challenging to balance reward signals effectively.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** To make LLMs safer, more aligned with human intent, and to improve their helpfulness and conversational quality. This is a key technique behind models like ChatGPT.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** A more recent and simpler alternative to RLHF. DPO directly optimizes the LLM on a dataset of human preferences (pairs of preferred and dispreferred responses) without needing to train a separate reward model or use complex RL algorithms.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   Simpler to implement than RLHF.\n",
       "    *   More stable training.\n",
       "    *   Often achieves comparable or better results than RLHF.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Still requires a dataset of human preferences.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** As a more efficient and stable alternative to RLHF for aligning LLMs with human preferences.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 6. Few-Shot Learning / In-Context Learning\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works:** This isn't strictly \"tuning\" in the sense of updating model weights. Instead, you provide the LLM with a few examples of the task directly within the prompt. The model then uses these examples to infer the task and generate an output for a new query.\n",
       "*   **Pros:**\n",
       "    *   No training required, extremely fast to adapt.\n",
       "    *   No computational cost for adaptation.\n",
       "*   **Cons:**\n",
       "    *   Performance is limited by the LLM's inherent capabilities and the quality of the few examples.\n",
       "    *   Context window limitations can restrict the number of examples.\n",
       "    *   Can be less robust than fine-tuning.\n",
       "*   **When to use:** For quick experimentation, when you have very few examples, or when you want to leverage the LLM's existing knowledge without modifying it.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Choosing the Right Method\n",
       "\n",
       "The best method for tuning an LLM depends on several factors:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Task Complexity:** Simple tasks might be fine with prompt tuning or few-shot learning, while complex tasks often benefit from fine-tuning.\n",
       "*   **Data Availability:** Full fine-tuning requires a large dataset, while PEFT methods can work with smaller datasets. RLHF and DPO require preference data.\n",
       "*   **Computational Resources:** Full fine-tuning is the most demanding, followed by adapter-based PEFT, then prompt tuning, and finally few-shot learning.\n",
       "*   **Desired Performance:** For maximum performance, full fine-tuning is often the best, but PEFT methods are closing the gap.\n",
       "*   **Alignment Needs:** If aligning with human values and safety is critical, RLHF or DPO are essential.\n",
       "*   **Storage Constraints:** PEFT methods offer significant advantages in terms of storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "In practice, a combination of these methods is often used. For example, a model might be instruction-tuned first, then further aligned using RLHF or DPO, and finally adapted to a specific downstream task using LoRA."

    "Adding the “AI expert” system instruction noticeably shifts the tone and depth of the gemini-2.5-flash-lite response.

The model expands each tuning method with clearer operational details, explicit pros and cons, practical use cases, and more specific terminology. It even introduces additional techniques such as DPO and P-Tuning that were not mentioned in the default response. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Pixar \\nWall-E \\n• \\nDirector: Andrew Stanton  \\n• \\nGenre: Sci-Fi  \\n• \\nRunning Time: 97 minutes \\nRated G: Big-hearted and full of wonder, but too smart to be saccharine. \\n“The first hour of Wall-E is a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless silent comedy of the sort that \\nCharlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make.” \\n \\nAll Things Considered, June 27, 2008 · The camera descends, at the start of Wall-E, from \\nouter space to a landscape that looks eerily familiar — and sort of not. The sun filters \\ndown through a brownish haze. What seem at first like skyscrapers turn out to be neatly \\nstacked mountains of trash. Stillness is everywhere, broken only by the unlikely sound of \\na song from Hello, Dolly! — and a solitary figure zipping around a junk-strewn \\ncityscape.  \\nApparently, humans never changed course on pollution and consumerism, and sometime \\nin the 22nd century they were forced to leave a planet they had turned into a giant \\ngarbage dump. But they left without turning off a robot they\\'d left behind. He\\'s basically \\na trash compactor on treads — a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class, or WALL-E \\n— who has, over the course of 700 years, developed a personality.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nHe tries to puzzle out what mankind\\'s detritus was for (a Rubik\\'s cube, a spork, a fire \\nextinguisher), and he saves a few items — an alarmingly fresh 700-year-old Twinkie, \\nsay, for his pet cockroach.  \\nBut most of the trash he compacts and stacks, in a routine that is interrupted only when he \\nfalls head-over-treads for a sleek robot from the stars: EVE (for Extra-terrestrial \\nVegetation Evaluator), whom he watches from afar so he won\\'t be incinerated.  \\nEve has an itchy trigger-finger, it turns out. \\nThe first hour of Wall-E is a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless \\nsilent comedy of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make. Things \\nturn more conventional in the last half hour, when pudgy, machine-dependent humans \\nmake an appearance, but the glow of that first part will carry you through.  \\nThat and the majesty of the filmmaking: Wall-E\\'s world, in all its epic decay, looks real. \\nYou can almost taste the dust. And it\\'s emotionally real too — enough so that a \\ncautionary tale about the environment, and about big corporations that don\\'t take care of \\nit, and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars all \\ntake a back seat to romance.  \\nSo do some specifically cinematic subtexts. Director Andrew Stanton and his animators \\nhave slipped in nods not just to Hello, Dolly!, but to Star Wars and Blade Runner, An \\nInconvenient Truth and the comedies of Chaplin and Jacques Tati. More than just a nod \\nto Chaplin, actually: Wall-E, with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for \\nsomeone to hold hands with, might as well be Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp. \\nThere\\'s actually a nice parallel between this largely silent film and Chaplin\\'s first sound \\nfilm, Modern Times. In that one, the silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music \\nand effects, not for speech, just as Pixar does here. Chaplin only let you hear a human \\nvoice a couple of times, and only on some sort of mechanical contraption — say a closed-\\ncircuit TV screen — to emphasize its artificiality. It was his way of saying to the sound \\nworld, \"OK, everybody\\'s doing this talking thing now, but look how much more \\nexpressive our silent world is.\"  \\nFor the first time in a Pixar movie, Wall-E\\'s filmmakers give a nod to the world of actual \\nactors and cameras — and make them artificial in the same way: by only letting you see \\nthem on video screens, where they look flat and washed-out compared to the digital \\nworld around them. \\nBut there\\'s one difference. Chaplin knew he had lost the battle: Silence was finished; \\nsound had won. In today\\'s Hollywood, digital is what\\'s taking over — in special effects, \\nin green-screen work, in animation. And Pixar\\'s animators, bless them, are at the\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 3**\\n\"\"\"\\nforefront, insisting that imagery created on computers doesn\\'t have to be soulless. Wall-\\nE\\'s images are filled with emotion, just as silent film\\'s images were — even though its \\ncharacters look like they\\'re made of metal and plastic, and can\\'t say a word.  \\nWall-E is being sold as a futuristic fantasy, of course. But I have to say I\\'m just as \\ngratified by their look back 70 years to silent movies as I am by their look forward 700 \\nyears to a silent planet.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "Langextract successfully extracted multiple evaluative and emotionally expressive phrases from the Wall-E review, with grounding accurately highlighting each span in the original text. Expressions such as “looks real” and “You can almost taste the dust” were correctly categorized as critical opinions or audience impact, demonstrating that the model can reliably identify evaluative tone, viewing experience, and visual descriptions. Overall extraction quality is consistent and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some multi-adjective opinion phrases were only partially extracted, resulting in incomplete representation of the reviewer’s full description. Additionally, several emotionally charged or atmospheric expressions were not classified as audience impact, causing recall to drop. The model also displayed a bias toward positive sentiment, labeling terms like “loneliness” or “emptiness” as positive, indicating insufficient sensitivity in sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Future works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall can be improved by increasing extraction_passes (e.g., to 2–3) and expanding max_char_buffer to provide more contextual continuity across batches. Adding more diverse few-shot examples—especially those containing mixed emotions, negative imagery, and atmospheric descriptions—can reduce sentiment bias and help the model better interpret the tone of film criticism. Clearer prompt rules can also prevent partial extraction of long descriptive phrases."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "The model responded that the document did not mention any information about NYCU relocating its earlier campus to the Guangfu site. However, the source text clearly includes a detailed description of the university’s relocation history—from the original Bo’ai Campus, to the consideration of Chengcing Lake in Kaohsiung, and finally to the Weiwuying military base, which later became the Guangfu Campus. The model’s answer was incorrect, the RAG system failed to retrieve the paragraph containing the relocation history.\n",

    "The likely reason the retriever failed to retrieve the relocation passage is the lack of direct keyword alignment. The question explicitly used the term “relocated”, but the document never used this word. Instead, the relocation history was described narratively, mentioning Bo’ai Campus, the consideration of Chengcing Lake, and the military’s offer of the Weiwuying site, without explicitly using terms such as “relocation,” “move,” or “transfer.” Because embedding-based retrieval still relies heavily on semantic similarity, the absence of these direct keywords reduced the match score, causing the retriever to overlook the relevant chunk despite the information being present.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "### **Comparison and Discussion of Zero-Shot, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot Classification Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Overall Performance Trend**\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the three settings, the performance improves as the number of shots increases.\n",
    "As seen from the results: more shots → the model better understands the classification logic → more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zero-shot: Most unstable, the model relies purely on its pretrained knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1-shot: Adding one example per emotion noticeably improves predictions for fear and anger.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5-shot: The most stable overall, with significant improvement especially in the anger category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fear category remains the most difficult emotion overall, with frequent confusion between anger and joy. The model still shows a tendency to collapse multiple negative emotions into similar predictions, suggesting that semantic boundaries between negative emotional expressions are not fully captured. Moreover, even with 5-shot prompting, sadness continues to be partially confused with anger due to shared wording patterns in social-media style texts. These limitations indicate that prompt examples alone cannot fully resolve category overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Providing higher-quality few-shot examples, especially those that highlight the distinction between fear vs. anger, could strengthen category boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incorporating longer context windows or emotion-specific linguistic cues into prompts may help the model better understand subtle sentiment differences."

    "### **Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Improved Cases — Examples Provide Useful Semantic Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "This improvement occurs because the examples help the LLM better recognize emotion-specific linguistic patterns. Demonstrations clarify category boundaries, especially between semantically similar emotions such as anger vs. sadness or fear vs. sadness. Thus, few-shot prompting provides an effective semantic scaffold that guides the model toward the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. No Improvement — Examples Do Not Address the Model’s Semantic Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "These failures commonly appear in the anger category, suggesting that the examples may not sufficiently cover the full diversity of how anger is expressed. Texts with implicit emotion, sarcasm, weak cues, or ambiguous context remain difficult for the model, and few-shot prompting cannot compensate when the examples lack coverage or the text’s emotional signal is too subtle. In these cases, model errors persist due to intrinsic ambiguity or insufficient representativeness in the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Worse Cases — Examples Introduce Bias or Misleading Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens when the LLM overfits the linguistic style of the examples, causing it to prioritize example, like phrasing over the actual input. If the examples disproportionately emphasize certain emotional cues, the model may generalize incorrectly and shift ambiguous texts into the wrong category. This demonstrates a classic few-shot limitation: poor or overly narrow examples can misguide the model more than having no examples at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that few-shot prompting can improve classification when examples provide diverse and accurate semantic cues. However, when examples lack coverage or introduce stylistic or category bias—the model may fail to improve or even perform worse. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ultimately, the quality and representativeness of examples matter far more than the number of examples.**"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
