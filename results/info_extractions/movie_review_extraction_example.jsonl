\nEvolutionary thinking: Wall-E may have started out as a glorified trash compactor, but he's learned how to look to the sky. Pixar \nWall-E \n• \nDirector: Andrew Stanton  \n• \nGenre: Sci-Fi  \n• \nRunning Time: 97 minutes \nRated G: Big-hearted and full of wonder, but too smart to be saccharine. \n“The first hour of Wall-E is a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless silent comedy of the sort that \nCharlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make.” \n \nAll Things Considered, June 27, 2008 · The camera descends, at the start of Wall-E, from \nouter space to a landscape that looks eerily familiar — and sort of not. The sun filters \ndown through a brownish haze. What seem at first like skyscrapers turn out to be neatly \nstacked mountains of trash. Stillness is everywhere, broken only by the unlikely sound of \na song from Hello, Dolly! — and a solitary figure zipping around a junk-strewn \ncityscape.  \nApparently, humans never changed course on pollution and consumerism, and sometime \nin the 22nd century they were forced to leave a planet they had turned into a giant \ngarbage dump. But they left without turning off a robot they'd left behind. He's basically \na trash compactor on treads — a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class, or WALL-E \n— who has, over the course of 700 years, developed a personality.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nHe tries to puzzle out what mankind's detritus was for (a Rubik's cube, a spork, a fire \nextinguisher), and he saves a few items — an alarmingly fresh 700-year-old Twinkie, \nsay, for his pet cockroach.  \nBut most of the trash he compacts and stacks, in a routine that is interrupted only when he \nfalls head-over-treads for a sleek robot from the stars: EVE (for Extra-terrestrial \nVegetation Evaluator), whom he watches from afar so he won't be incinerated.  \nEve has an itchy trigger-finger, it turns out. \nThe first hour of Wall-E is a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless \nsilent comedy of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make. Things \nturn more conventional in the last half hour, when pudgy, machine-dependent humans \nmake an appearance, but the glow of that first part will carry you through.  \nThat and the majesty of the filmmaking: Wall-E's world, in all its epic decay, looks real. \nYou can almost taste the dust. And it's emotionally real too — enough so that a \ncautionary tale about the environment, and about big corporations that don't take care of \nit, and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars all \ntake a back seat to romance.  \nSo do some specifically cinematic subtexts. Director Andrew Stanton and his animators \nhave slipped in nods not just to Hello, Dolly!, but to Star Wars and Blade Runner, An \nInconvenient Truth and the comedies of Chaplin and Jacques Tati. More than just a nod \nto Chaplin, actually: Wall-E, with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for \nsomeone to hold hands with, might as well be Chaplin's Little Tramp. \nThere's actually a nice parallel between this largely silent film and Chaplin's first sound \nfilm, Modern Times. In that one, the silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music \nand effects, not for speech, just as Pixar does here. Chaplin only let you hear a human \nvoice a couple of times, and only on some sort of mechanical contraption — say a closed-\ncircuit TV screen — to emphasize its artificiality. It was his way of saying to the sound \nworld, \"OK, everybody's doing this talking thing now, but look how much more \nexpressive our silent world is.\"  \nFor the first time in a Pixar movie, Wall-E's filmmakers give a nod to the world of actual \nactors and cameras — and make them artificial in the same way: by only letting you see \nthem on video screens, where they look flat and washed-out compared to the digital \nworld around them. \nBut there's one difference. Chaplin knew he had lost the battle: Silence was finished; \nsound had won. In today's Hollywood, digital is what's taking over — in special effects, \nin green-screen work, in animation. And Pixar's animators, bless them, are at the\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nforefront, insisting that imagery created on computers doesn't have to be soulless. Wall-\nE's images are filled with emotion, just as silent film's images were — even though its \ncharacters look like they're made of metal and plastic, and can't say a word.  \nWall-E is being sold as a futuristic fantasy, of course. But I have to say I'm just as \ngratified by their look back 70 years to silent movies as I am by their look forward 700 \nyears to a silent planet.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_75412ea4"}
