Running Time: 97 minutes 
Rated G: <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Big-hearted and full of wonder, but too smart to be saccharine.</span> 
“The first hour of Wall-E is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a crazily inventive, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">deliriously engaging</span> and almost wordless silent comedy of the sort that 
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make</span>.” 

All Things Considered, June 27, 2008 · The camera descends, at the start of Wall-E, from 
outer space to a landscape that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">looks eerily familiar — and sort of not.</span> The sun filters 
down through a brownish haze. What seem at first like skyscrapers turn out to be neatly 
stacked mountains of trash. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stillness is everywhere</span>, broken only by the unlikely sound of 
a song from Hello, Dolly! — and a solitary figure zipping around a junk-strewn 
cityscape.  
Apparently, humans never changed course on pollution and consumerism, and sometime 
in the 22nd century they were forced to leave a planet they had turned into a giant 
garbage dump. But they left without turning off a robot they&#x27;d left behind. He&#x27;s basically 
a trash compactor on treads — a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class, or WALL-E 
— who has, over the course of 700 years, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">developed a personality.</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
He tries to puzzle out what mankind&#x27;s detritus was for (a Rubik&#x27;s cube, a spork, a fire 
extinguisher), and he saves a few items — an alarmingly fresh 700-year-old Twinkie, 
say, for his pet cockroach.  
But most of the trash he compacts and stacks, in a routine that is interrupted only when he 
falls head-over-treads for a sleek robot from the stars: EVE (for Extra-terrestrial 
Vegetation Evaluator), whom he watches from afar so he won&#x27;t be incinerated.  
Eve has an itchy trigger-finger, it turns out. 
The first hour of Wall-E is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless 
silent comedy</span> of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make. Things 
turn <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">more conventional</span> in the last half hour, when pudgy, machine-dependent humans 
make an appearance, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the glow of that first part will carry you through</span>.  
That and the majesty of the filmmaking: Wall-E&#x27;s world, in all its epic decay, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">looks real</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">You can almost taste the dust</span>. And it&#x27;s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">emotionally real</span> too — enough so that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a 
cautionary tale about the environment, and about big corporations that don&#x27;t take care of 
it, and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars all 
take a back seat to romance</span>.  
So do some specifically cinematic subtexts. Director Andrew Stanton and his animators 
have slipped in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nods not just to Hello, Dolly!, but to Star Wars and Blade Runner, An 
Inconvenient Truth and the comedies of Chaplin and Jacques Tati</span>. More than just a nod 
to Chaplin, actually: Wall-E, with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for 
someone to hold hands with, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">might as well be Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp</span>. 
There&#x27;s actually a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nice parallel</span> between this largely silent film and Chaplin&#x27;s first sound 
film, Modern Times. In that one, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music 
and effects, not for speech</span>, just as Pixar does here. Chaplin only let you hear a human 
voice a couple of times, and only on some sort of mechanical contraption — say a closed-
circuit TV screen — to emphasize its artificiality. It was his way of saying to the sound 
world, &quot;OK, everybody&#x27;s doing this talking thing now, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">look how much more 
expressive our silent world is</span>.&quot;  
For the first time in a Pixar movie, Wall-E&#x27;s filmmakers give a nod to the world of actual 
actors and cameras — and make them artificial in the same way: by only letting you see 
them on video screens, where they <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">look flat and washed-out</span> compared to the digital 
world around them. 
But there&#x27;s one difference. Chaplin knew he had lost the battle: Silence was finished; 
sound had won. In today&#x27;s Hollywood, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">digital is what&#x27;s taking over</span> — in special effects, 
in green-screen work, in animation. And Pixar&#x27;s animators, bless them, are at the
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
forefront, insisting that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">imagery created on computers doesn&#x27;t have to be soulless</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wall-
E&#x27;s images are filled with emotion</span>, just as silent film&#x27;s images were — even though its 
characters look like they&#x27;re made of metal and plastic, and can&#x27;t say a word.  
Wall-E is being sold as a futuristic fantasy, of course. But I have to say I&#x27;m just as 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gratified by their look back 70 years to silent movies</span> as I am by their look forward 700 
years to a silent planet</span>.
